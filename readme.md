# Fun with Bezier Curves (BBC Micro)

Given a simple SVG (one that just contains cubic splines and lines - no transforms, arcs, fills etc) we use a python script to create a binary file, and a BBC BASIC program to load and render it.

See *disk.ssd* for the disk image, and bezier.bas.txt for the BASIC program.
